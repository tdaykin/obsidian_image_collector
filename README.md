# Image Collector Plugin

## Purpose:

Collects all images from your current note and saves them to a new folder. 

I often find that I want to collect all images within a note, whether it is for:

- Transforming the .md file to latex so I can keep all the images together; instead of handpicking the images from an attachments directory.
- Making posts to my GitHub pages website so I can use Obsidian to create the content, but I still need a way to collect all images from the .md file to upload to GitHub.

## How to use:

While in note either `CTRL + P` to open command palette and run `Image Collector: Export markdown images` **or** right click on current open note and select `Export images`
