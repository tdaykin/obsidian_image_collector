# Image Collector Plugin

## Purpose:

I often find that I want to collect all images within a note whether it is for:

- transforming the md file to latex so I can keep all the images together; instead of handpicking the images from an attachments directory into my new latex project
- making posts to my github pages website so I can use Obsidian to create the posts, but I still need a way to collect all images from the md file to upload to github

This plugin offers a seamless experience rather than having to either find all of the images after you have made your note *or* beforehand create folders specific to each project to store images. You can now just run a command to generate a folder that contains all of your note's images so you can drag into other project directories.

## How to use:
These steps are required to use this plugin:

1. In Obsidian go to Settings > Options > Files and links. Select the *default location for new attachments* to be **in the folder specified below**. Then choose a folder.
2. In Settings, Community plugins > Image Collector > Image Folder Path *make sure the folder specified there* **is the same as step 1**
3. While in note either `CTRL + P` to open terminal and run `Image Collector: Export Markdown Image` **or** right click on current open note and select `Export Images`
