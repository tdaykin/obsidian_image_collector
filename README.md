# Image Collector Plugin

## How to use:

While in note either `CTRL + P` to open command palette and run `Image Collector: Export markdown images` **or** right click on current open note and select `Export images`

## Purpose:

I often find that I want to collect all images within a note, whether it is for:

- Transforming my school notes to latex, no longer having to handpick the images from my attachments directory.
- Making posts to my GitHub pages website, so I can use Obsidian to create the content and simply upload all associated images to GitHub.
